The Matrech Guard was sent in, and I was senior advisor to the  general in charge.  Well, opinions in Matrech were split. The chancellor was wary of agitating  a large neighbour like the republic and wanted to settle the dispute quickly. Others saw it at a chance to spread  their influence and advocated anything from annexing Cayeska to actually  invading Fairwind territory. By the way, one of the champions for the latter  cause was none other than Governor  Vosch. Anyway, I came up a plan to sweep the  invading army from Cayeska from the north and take one of their key ports as a bargaining tool for a settlement. It all went wrong when politicians in  Matrech started meddling with our  plans. Different factions would send their people over to review our plans and try to change our minds. Officers  were removed from the front and  replaced with more 'agreeable' ones. As a result of all this, army unity was  lost as it dissolved into cliques of like-minded people more concerned about furthering their own goals than  following our overall strategy. Sure, we won the war, and in Matrech it was spun as a grand victory, but in  truth, it was a disaster. My plans anticipated a two to three month  campaign. In the end, it took almost two years, and ravaged the area.  Highland managed okay, but it seriously strained our relations with Cayeska, a former part of the Zelmony Kingdom."

For example, this is the 106th  word I've said to you so far in this  interview, out of the 4312 I say on an  average day. If we're now halfway  through the interview, that means that  it amounts to 4.9% of my daily speech.
