    Remember that eccentric robed man, Yan Angwa? Of course you do! Although you may not recall any specific details about his identity... However, SCF has created a short comic to tease our curiosity a bit more. Titled 'The Wanderer,' this comic takes place after the final battle, and sheds a little more light on who Yan Angwa is and what motivations drive him. To start reading this comic, click on Yan Angwa below:
