    Welcome to The Hand of Fate

  <p>
    Welcome to The Hand of Fate, an <b>Exit Fate</b> fan site. If you don't already know, but have found yourself here anyway, <b>Exit Fate</b> is a role-playing game created by <a href="http://site.scfworks.com/?page_id=31">SCF</a> with the use of the <b>RPG Maker XP</b> computer software. For further information on the game itself, check the 'About Exit Fate' link provided in the menu above.

      Before you venture further into this site, let me point out that this site uses the MS Gothic font face, so if you don't have it installed, the site will likely appear rather screwy. If you don't have this font installed, you can download it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1269">here</a>.

  <h2>Update (06/29/19)</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, been a while! ...A <i>long</i> while. Truth be told, I just haven't really had the time to do much with the site these days. I still check in on the forum semi-frequently, but other than that, I think the site's mostly going to remain in its current state. On the topic of the forum, though: I just noticed the link to the forum doesn't appear to be redirecting anymore (for those unaware, InvisionFree merged with Tapatalk, so lots of stuff changed), so I updated the forum link in the main site's menu. However, I'm a total novice at web design, so the menu is actually individually typed out for every single page on the site, which is quite a lot at this point. Suffice it to say I don't have the time at the moment to update every single page, but I've updated all of the main pages, at least. If the link on a given page you're viewing isn't working, just come back to this page or any of the others listed in the menu, and it should work from there. I'll try to get on to fix the other links when I can, but in the meantime, please bear with this psuedo-solution.
